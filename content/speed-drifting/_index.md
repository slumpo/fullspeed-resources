# Speed Drifting

So you want to go faster? A Speed Drift (SD), also known as a Speed Slide, is the main advanced mechanic in fullspeed maps to help the player gain speed faster than normal driving. This is one of the most popular aspects of fullspeed and has been covered in multiple tutorial videos on YouTube, most popularly from the professional player and fullspeed GOAT, Mudda: [How to Speed Drift in Trackmania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nka1MZiudI)

Just about every single modern fullspeed track is built with SD’s in mind. This means that each feature is connected by section(s) of intended slides, calculated by the mapper. 

This chapter will cover the basics on how to both start and carry speed drifts throughout a fullspeed map, and the different variations of drifts, surfaces, and driving methods players use to take advantage of this unique trick.
